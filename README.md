# Racebox
Race signals and results for dinghy racing

Working on this for Frensham Pond SC

Provides a connection to USB relays\
in order to control a horn system or lights\
Supports 10-5-Go and 5-4-1-Go start sequences\
Later will add a way to record finish times and specify competitors

Currently the common/inexpensive HID USB relays are supported\
that use the instruction set for the CH340 (or) CH341) relays\
These relays quite often have the "Songle" name on the components
